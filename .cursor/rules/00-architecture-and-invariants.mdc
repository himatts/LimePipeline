# Purpose
- Keep this rule short; details live in @ARCHITECTURE.md and scoped rules.

# Architecture (high-level)
- Modules: core, data, scene, ops, ui.
- UI/messages in English; future-friendly for Blender i18n. Code, comments, identifiers in English.
- Prefer native Blender UI elements; avoid custom widgets/drawing unless necessary.

# Invariants (single source of truth)
- Project root matches `^[A-Z]{2}-\d{5}\s+(.+)$`
- Revision letter is exactly one A–Z
- PV/REND/SB/ANIM require SC (1–999); unless `free_scene_numbering`, SC must be multiple of `scene_step`
