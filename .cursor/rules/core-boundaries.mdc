# Core rules
- Do not import `bpy` at module level; local imports inside functions only.
- Constants/regex live here. Reuse `core.naming` + `core.paths` + `core.validate`; avoid duplication.
- Public functions: typed + short docstrings.

# Canonical helpers
@lime_pipeline/core/naming.py
@lime_pipeline/core/paths.py
