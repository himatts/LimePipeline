# View3D / Image Editor panels
- `draw()` no IO/hydration, no state mutation; keep fast and deterministic.
- Messages/tooltips in EN. Code, comments, identifiers in English. Show warnings from `core.validate`.
- Reuse properties from `WindowManager.lime_pipeline`; do not scan disk.
- Prefer native Blender UI elements (layout, operators, props); avoid custom GPU drawing or non-standard widgets unless strictly necessary.
