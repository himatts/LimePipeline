# UI â€” Lime Toolbox (rules)

## Purpose
- The **Lime Toolbox** tab is the home for upcoming tools related to **animation** and **materials**.
- Out of scope: touching saves/paths/renders logic.

## Alignment
- Keep UI text **in English**.
- **Fast UI**: no blocking operations, keep draw lightweight.
- **No IO or state mutation in `draw()`**.

## Naming & Structure
- Panels: `LIME_TB_PT_*`.
- Operators: `LIME_TB_OT_*`, with `bl_idname = "lime.tb_*"`.
- Keep Toolbox modules separate from Pipeline ones. If Toolbox needs properties later, create a dedicated `PropertyGroup` (e.g., `WindowManager.lime_toolbox`).

## MVP Status
- Placeholder only. No heavy logic. The button should only `report({'INFO'}, ...)`.

## Acceptance Checklist
- Add-on installs & enables without errors.
- **Lime Toolbox** tab is visible in the Sidebar (N) within View3D.
- Clicking **Do Nothing (WIP)** shows an INFO message.
- Existing Lime Pipeline panels work unchanged.
